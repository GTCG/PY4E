# PY4E -- Python for everybody course--
Lectured by Dr. Charles Severance @ Coursera: http://www.coursera.org

Here you can find all the assignments for the Python for everybody specialization course which I took from June til December 2016 on Coursera.
I did all the assignments with python 2.7 and python 3.x. Check the folders for the version you need. You will need SQLite for some of the assignments.

I also created a capstone project called "Deathrow". You can find it on my Github as well.

Feel free to report errors or possible improvements.
